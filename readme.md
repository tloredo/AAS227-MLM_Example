# PyStan gamma-Poisson MLM example for AAS 227

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook and some support files, demonstrating use of the Stan probabilistic programming language to implement a basic Bayesian multilevel model, the gamma-Poisson model, in a mock astronomical setting.
Clone it and run the notebook, which is self-documenting.
